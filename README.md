### Xyst Creator: Wolfyy#6841

## Introduction
Hello! I am Wolfyy, the creator of Xyst. I created this discord bot as I loved Rythm and Groovy before they went down but I wished they had more features and weren't just a music bot. I made this bot so I wouldn't have to use multiple bots for stuff like random fun or economy. I am not making moderation in this bot however, Dyno does it much better so I am just using that. If you don't know what Dyno is, you can get it [here](https://www.dyno.gg/).
